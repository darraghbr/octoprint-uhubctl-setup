This is a description of how I have used uhubctl to automatically turn on and off a USB powered HDMI screen attached to my Octoprint Raspberry Pi.

First you must install uhubctl by mvp, which can be found [here.](https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl) follow the installation instructions that are contained in that repo.

I have then included the code snippets in the 'config.yaml' file that you should include in your config.yaml file which can be found in /home/pi/.octoprint/ 

It can also be added to the GUI in the System Command Editor plugin, this will allow you to have buttons on the drop down box to turn on and off the screen.
